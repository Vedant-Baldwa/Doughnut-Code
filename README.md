# Doughnut-Code
Found this Very fascinating code. This was written by Andy Sloane. He wrote this code in c language in the shape of a Doughnut, which on compiling produced a spinning doughnut made with different symbols. There was some complex maths used in writing this code. His main intention in writing this was to tell everyone that math is the basic foundation of Programming. This Inspired me to learn more about programming and developed an interest in math.
